# mockCartMart

mockCartMart is a minimalist faux e-commerce web application that demonstrates a custom shopping cart implementation.

Developed as part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart), mockCartMart provided me with invaluable hands-on experience and deepened my understanding of working with React and React libraries including but not limited to,

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
- [React Router Library](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Styled Components Library](https://styled-components.com/)

**Live Preview:** [Hosted on Cloudflare Pages]()

## Learning Outcomes

- **Testing React Components**
  - Set up and wrote unit tests using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).
  - Simulated user actions with `user-event` library.

  - Gained a fundamental understanding of the [Styled Components Library](https://styled-components.com/).
  - Improved cohesive and modular nature of components.
- **React Principles**
  - Deepened understanding of core principles and fundamentals:
    - State management
    - Uni-directional data-flow
    - Context management
    - Asynchronous operations with useEffect
    - JSX syntax
    - environment setup with Vite toolchain
    - Lazy loading and Suspense
    - Component-based project architecture
    - Type checking with the [PropTypes Library](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types).
